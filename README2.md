My practice repository
Hello world,
Looking for new experiences here at Git hub. Maybe start a new hobby. I am using a Linux Debisan system. I want to learn how to use Git hub because I use open source all the time. I think it might be interesting, this seemed like a good place to start. I'll give it a try and find out.
